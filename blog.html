                    A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a
                    sentence called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has several important functions: it
                    substantiates or supports an essayâ€™s thesis statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and
                    directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how
                    the paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to
                    determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph.
